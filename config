Use the WebClient class in System.Net:

var json = new WebClient().DownloadString("url");
Keep in mind that WebClient is IDisposable, so you would probably add a using statement to this in production code. This would look like:

using (WebClient wc = new WebClient())
{
   var json = wc.DownloadString("url");
